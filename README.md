#### Hi

I'm currently working with and learning about eBPF (XDP) and DPDK / VPP.

Most of my development resides on private gitlab instances.

Interests include:
 * High bandwidth networking
 * DevOps / Automation
 * Fuzzing / Automatic Pentesting
 * Metrics / Data visualisation
 * Data science / analysis

If you need to contact me i'd prefer you do so via matrix: @blong:matrix.mreow.de
